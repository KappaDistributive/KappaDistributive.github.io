I"ÿ<p>For the last 5 years or so, Iâ€™ve been lurking on the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">Code Golf Stackexchange</a>. Code Golf is the art of solving a given problem, under specified rules, with as little written code as possible. And if you have never encountered â€˜golfed codeâ€™, I highly recommend taking a look. Not sure about other people but to my nerdy brain, reading the ingenious approaches these incredibly talented and passionate coders come up with, is pure entertainment gold!</p>
