I"‘<p>Life is pretty crazy right now. Finishing a PhD, changing from set theory to applied data science, forming connections to other data scientists, learning as much about machine learning (both theory and practice) as I possibly can, finding a new apartment and preparing to move, dealing with German bureaucracyâ€¦ This doesnâ€™t leave a lot of spare time. Truth be told, it doesnâ€™t leave any.</p>
